    MatrixBandwidth

Fast algorithms for matrix bandwidth minimization and recognition, written in Julia.

The *bandwidth* of an ``n×n`` matrix ``A`` is the minimum non-negative integer
``k ∈ \\{0, 1, …, n - 1\\}`` such that ``A[i, j] = 0`` whenever ``|i - j| > k``. Reordering
the rows and columns of a matrix to reduce its bandwidth has many practical applications in
engineering and scientific computing: it can improve performance when solving linear
systems, approximating partial differential equations, optimizing circuit layout, and more
[Maf14, p. 184]. There are two variants of this problem: *minimization*, which involves
finding a permutation matrix ``P`` such that the bandwidth of ``PAPᵀ`` is minimized, and
*recognition*, which entails determining whether there exists a permutation matrix ``P``
such that the bandwidth of ``PAPᵀ`` is at most some fixed non-negative integer (an optimal
permutation that fully minimizes the bandwidth of ``A`` is not required).

Many matrix bandwidth reduction algorithms exist in the literature, but implementations in
the open-source ecosystem are scarce, with those that do exist primarily tackling older,
less efficient algorithms. The [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) libraries in C++, the
[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) library in Python, and the MATLAB standard library all
only implement the reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm from 1971. This gap in the ecosystem not
only makes it difficult for theoretical researchers to benchmark and compare new proposed
algorithms but also precludes the application of the most performant modern algorithms in
real-life industry settings. MatrixBandwidth.jl aims to bridge this gap by presenting a
unified interface for matrix bandwidth reduction algorithms in Julia, designed with
extensibility to further methods in mind.

The following matrix bandwidth reduction algorithms are currently available:
- **Minimization**
    - *Exact*
        - Del Corso–Manzini ([`Minimization.DelCorsoManzini`](@ref))
        - Del Corso–Manzini with perimeter search
            ([`Minimization.DelCorsoManziniWithPS`](@ref))
        - Caprara–Salazar-González ([`Minimization.CapraraSalazarGonzalez`](@ref))
        - Saxe–Gurari–Sudborough ([`Minimization.SaxeGurariSudborough`](@ref))
        - Brute-force search ([`Minimization.BruteForceSearch`](@ref))
    - *Heuristic*
        - Gibbs–Poole–Stockmeyer ([`Minimization.GibbsPooleStockmeyer`](@ref))
        - Cuthill–McKee ([`Minimization.CuthillMcKee`](@ref))
        - Reverse Cuthill–McKee ([`Minimization.ReverseCuthillMcKee`](@ref))
- **Recognition**
    - Del Corso–Manzini ([`Recognition.DelCorsoManzini`](@ref))
    - Del Corso–Manzini with perimeter search ([`Recognition.DelCorsoManziniWithPS`](@ref))
    - Caprara–Salazar-González ([`Recognition.CapraraSalazarGonzalez`](@ref))
    - Saxe–Gurari–Sudborough ([`Recognition.SaxeGurariSudborough`](@ref))
    - Brute-force search ([`Recognition.BruteForceSearch`](@ref))

Recognition algorithms determine whether any row-and-column permutation of a matrix induces
bandwidth less than or equal to some fixed integer. Exact minimization algorithms always
guarantee optimal orderings to minimize bandwidth, while heuristic minimization algorithms
produce near-optimal solutions more quickly. Metaheuristic minimization algorithms employ
iterative search frameworks to find better solutions than heuristic methods (albeit more
slowly); no such algorithms are already implemented, but several (e.g., simulated annealing)
are currently under development.

This package also exports several additional core functions, including (but not limited to)
[`bandwidth`](@ref) and [`profile`](@ref) to compute the original bandwidth and profile of a
matrix prior to any reordering.
