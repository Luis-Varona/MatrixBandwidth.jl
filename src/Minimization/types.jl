    BandMinResult

Output struct for matrix bandwidth minimization results.

# Fields
- `matrix::M`: the original matrix whose bandwidth is minimized.
- `bandwidth::Int`: the minimized bandwidth of the matrix.
- `ordering::Vector{Int}`: the (near-)optimal ordering of the rows and columns.
- `solver::S`: the algorithm used to minimize the bandwidth.
- `approach::Symbol`: the approach used by the solver. (Should be one of `:exact`,
    `:heuristic`, and `:metaheuristic`.)

# Constructors
- `BandMinResult(matrix, bandwidth, ordering, solver)`: constructs a new
    [`BandMinResult`](@ref) instance with the given fields. The `approach` field is
    automatically determined based on the solver type.
