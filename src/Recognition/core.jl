    has_bandwidth_k_ordering(A, k, decider=CapraraSalazarGonzalez()) -> RecognitionResult

Determine whether `A` has bandwidth at most `k` using the algorithm defined by `decider`.

The *bandwidth* of an ``n×n`` matrix ``A`` is the minimum non-negative integer
``k ∈ \\{0, 1, …, n - 1\\}`` such that ``A[i, j] = 0`` whenever ``|i - j| > k``.
Equivalently, ``A`` has bandwidth *at most* ``k`` if all entries above the ``k``ᵗʰ
superdiagonal and below the ``k``ᵗʰ subdiagonal are zero, and ``A`` has bandwidth *at least*
``k`` if there exists any nonzero entry in the ``k``ᵗʰ superdiagonal or subdiagonal.

Given some fixed non-negative integer `k`, this function determines (with 100% certainty)
whether there exists some ordering ``π`` of the rows and columns of ``A`` such that the
bandwidth of ``PAPᵀ`` is at most `k`, where ``P`` is the permutation matrix corresponding to
``π``. This is known to be decidable in ``O(nᵏ)`` time, although some deciders (e.g.,
[`CapraraSalazarGonzalez`](@ref)) run in exponential time instead to produce even quicker
runtimes in practice.

If ``k ≥ n - 1``, then this function immediately answers in the affirmative, since the
maximum possible bandwidth of an ``n×n`` matrix is ``n - 1``. After this initial check, a
preliminary lower bound on the bandwidth is computed in ``O(n³)`` time using results from
Caprara and Salazar-González (2005). If this lower bound is greater than ``k```

# Arguments
- `A::AbstractMatrix{<:Number}`: the (square) matrix whose bandwidth is tested.
- `k::Integer`: the threshold bandwidth against which to test.
- `decider::AbstractDecider`: the matrix bandwidth recognition algorithm to use; defaults to
    [`CapraraSalazarGonzalez`](@ref). (See the [`Recognition`](@ref) module documentation
    for a full list of supported deciders.)

# Returns
- `::RecognitionResult`: a struct containing the algorithm used, the original matrix `A`,
    the identified ordering of the rows and columns (if one exists), the threshold bandwidth
    `k`, and a boolean indicating whether the ordering exists.

# Examples
Multiple algorithms to decide whether a given matrix has bandwidth at most `k` are
available. Naturally, they will always agree, but the final orderings produced (in the case
of an affirmative) may differ:

If no decider is specified, then the Del Corso–Manzini algorithm is used by default:

# Notes
To implement a new matrix bandwidth recognition algorithm, define a new concrete subtype of
[`AbstractDecider`](@ref) then implement a corresponding
`_has_bandwidth_k_ordering_impl(::AbstractMatrix{Bool}, ::Integer, ::NewDeciderType)`
method. Do *not* attempt to directly implement a new `has_bandwidth_k_ordering` method, as
the function contains common preprocessing logic independent of the specific algorithm used.

Note also that some texts define matrix bandwidth to be the minimum non-negative integer
``k`` such that ``A[i, j] = 0`` whenever ``|i - j| ≥ k`` instead, particularly in more
mathematically-minded communities. Effectively, this definition treats diagonal matrices as
bandwidth ``1``, tridiagonal matrices as bandwidth ``2``, and so on. Our definition, on the
other hand, is more common in computer science contexts, treating diagonal matrices as
bandwidth ``0`` and tridiagonal matrices as bandwidth ``1``. (Both definitions, however,
agree that the bandwidth of an empty matrix is simply ``0``.)
