    HeuristicSolver <: AbstractSolver

Abstract type for all heuristic matrix bandwidth minimization solvers.

Heuristic methods are those which aim to produce near-optimal solutions in a more performant
manner than exact methods. While precise bandwidth minimization is NP-complete, many
heuristic algorithms (such as reverse Cuthillâ€“McKee) run in polynomial time.

Heuristic algorithms differ from metaheuristic ones in that they do not employ higher-level
iterative search frameworks (e.g., stochastic techniques) to survey the global search space
and escape local minima; instead, they rely on straightforward deterministic procedures to
find good solutions in a single pass.
