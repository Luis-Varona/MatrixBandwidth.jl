Reordering the rows and columns of a matrix to reduce its bandwidth has many practical applications in engineering and scientific computing: it can improve performance when solving linear systems, approximating partial differential equations, optimizing circuit layout, and more [Maf14, p. 184]. There are two variants of this problem: minimization, which involves finding a permutation matrix P such that the bandwidth of PAPᵀ is minimized, and recognition, which entails determining whether there exists a permutation matrix P such that the bandwidth of PAPᵀ is at most some fixed non-negative integer (an optimal permutation that fully minimizes the bandwidth of A is not required).\n\nMany matrix bandwidth reduction algorithms exist in the literature, but implementations in the open-source ecosystem are scarce, with those that do exist primarily tackling older, less efficient algorithms. The Boost libraries in C++, the NetworkX library in Python, and the MATLAB standard library all only implement the reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm from 1971. This gap in the ecosystem not only makes it difficult for theoretical researchers to benchmark and compare new proposed algorithms but also precludes the application of the most performant modern algorithms in real-life industry settings. MatrixBandwidth.jl aims to bridge this gap by presenting a unified interface for matrix bandwidth reduction algorithms in Julia, designed with extensibility to further methods in mind.\n\nThe following matrix bandwidth reduction algorithms are currently available:\n\nMinimization\nExact\nDel Corso–Manzini (Minimization.DelCorsoManzini)\nDel Corso–Manzini with perimeter search   (Minimization.DelCorsoManziniWithPS)\nCaprara–Salazar-González (Minimization.CapraraSalazarGonzalez)\nSaxe–Gurari–Sudborough (Minimization.SaxeGurariSudborough)\nBrute-force search (Minimization.BruteForceSearch)\nHeuristic\nGibbs–Poole–Stockmeyer (Minimization.GibbsPooleStockmeyer)\nCuthill–McKee (Minimization.CuthillMcKee)\nReverse Cuthill–McKee (Minimization.ReverseCuthillMcKee)\nRecognition\nDel Corso–Manzini (Recognition.DelCorsoManzini)\nDel Corso–Manzini with perimeter search (Recognition.DelCorsoManziniWithPS)\nCaprara–Salazar-González (Recognition.CapraraSalazarGonzalez)\nSaxe–Gurari–Sudborough (Recognition.SaxeGurariSudborough)\nBrute-force search (Recognition.BruteForceSearch)\n\nRecognition algorithms determine whether any row-and-column permutation of a matrix induces bandwidth less than or equal to some fixed integer. Exact minimization algorithms always guarantee optimal orderings to minimize bandwidth, while heuristic minimization algorithms produce near-optimal solutions more quickly. Metaheuristic minimization algorithms employ iterative search frameworks to find better solutions than heuristic methods (albeit more slowly); no such algorithms are already implemented, but several (e.g., simulated annealing) are currently under development.\n\nThis package also exports several additional core functions, including (but not limited to) bandwidth and profile to compute the original bandwidth and profile of a matrix prior to any reordering.\n\nThe full documentation is available at GitHub Pages.\n\nReferences\n\n[Maf14]: L.

For a fixed k  ℕ, the algorithm performs a depth-first search of all partial orderings of the rows and columns of A, adding indices one at a time. Partial orderings are pruned not only by ensuring that adjacent pairs of currently placed indices are within k of each other but also by employing a branch-and-bound framework with lower bounds on bandwidth compatibility computed via integer linear programming relaxations. This search is repeated with incrementing values of k until a bandwidth-k ordering is found [CS05], with k initialized to some lower bound on the minimum bandwidth of A up to symmetric permutation.\n\nSpecifically, this implementation of the Caprara–Salazar-González algorithm uses the min(α(A) γ(A)) lower bound from the original paper [CS05, pp. 359–60] as the initial value of k. (Further implementation details can be found in the source code for bandwidth_lower_bound.)\n\nAs noted above, the Caprara–Salazar-González algorithm requires structurally symmetric input (that is, Ai j must be nonzero if and only if Aj i is nonzero for 1  i j  n).\n\nSupertype Hierarchy\n\nCapraraSalazarGonzalez <: ExactSolver <: AbstractSolver <: MatrixBandwidth.AbstractAlgorithm\n\nPerformance\n\nGiven an nn input matrix, the Caprara–Salazar-González algorithm runs in O(n  n  Tᵢₗₚ(n n²)) time, where Tᵢₗₚ(n m) is the time taken to solve an  integer linear programming (ILP) problem with O(n) variables and O(m) constraints:\n\nFor each underlying \"bandwidth ≤ k\" check, we perform a depth-first search of   O(n) partial orderings.\nAt each search node, we solve ILP relaxations with n variables and O(n²)   constraints (given by the number of nonzero entries in the computed distance matrix),   taking Tᵢₗₚ(n n²) time. (This dominates the O(n²) auxiliary computations needed   to set up the ILP.) Thus, the overall time complexity for each value of k is   O(n  Tᵢₗₚ(n n²)).\nThe difference between the maximum possible bandwidth (n - 1) and our initial lower   bound grows linearly in n, so we run the underlying O(n  Tᵢₗₚ(n n²))   recognition algorithm O(n) times.\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is O(n  n  Tᵢₗₚ(n n²)).\n\nNote that Tᵢₗₚ(n n²) has worst-case complexity O(2ⁿ), although this ultimately depends on the ILP solver used.

For a fixed k  ℕ, the algorithm invokes a subroutine that determines whether A has bandwidth at most k up to symmetric permutation. This subroutine employs dynamic programming to search over equivalence classes of partial orderings, where two partial orderings of length l are equivalent if they share the same active region. (The active region of a partial ordering is defined as the sequence of the last min(k l) vertices in the ordering taken together with all dangling edges—edges with one endpoint in the ordering and the other endpoint not yet in the ordering.) It extends these partial layouts one vertex at a time in a breadth-first manner, pruning implausible classes that violate bandwidth-k constraints such as degree bounds on active vertices and excessive numbers of dangling edges [GS84]. This search is repeated with incrementing values of k until a bandwidth-k ordering is found, with k initialized to some lower bound on the minimum bandwidth of A up to symmetric permutation.\n\nSpecifically, this implementation of the Saxe–Gurari–Sudborough algorithm uses the min(α(A) γ(A)) lower bound from [CS05, pp. 359–60] as the initial value of k.

[Sax80] answered this question in the negative by providing a O(nᵏ¹) algorithm, constructively proving that the problem is class P. Later, [GS84] improved upon this algorithm by reducing time complexity to O(nᵏ). Whereas the original Saxe algorithm considers extensions of partial orderings with any remaining unplaced vertex (of which there are O(n) at any point in the breadth-first search), the Gurari–Sudborough refinement only considers extensions with vertices reachable by paths beginning with a dangling edge that never again traverse a dangling edge [GS84, pp. 535–36].\n\nReferences\n\n[GGJK78]: M.

It considers the graph G(A) whose adjacency matrix is A (ignoring weights and self-loops) and builds an ordering by identifying a pair of \"endpoints\" in the graph far from each other, constructing sets of levels from these endpoints, and merging these level structures in such a way that minimizes the size of the largest level in the final combined structure. Based on the classical reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm [Geo71], this heuristic typically produces an ordering which induces a matrix bandwidth either equal to or very close to the true minimum, with improvements in bandwidths over reverse Cuthill–McKee more noticeable once input size exceeds 400400 or so [GPS76, pp. 246–47].\n\nWhereas the original paper outlined a strategy for conditionally reversing the orderings of individual \"connected components\" (treating the input matrix A as an undirected graph) [GPS76, p. 241], this implementation instead reverses the entire final ordering in every case, similarly to ReverseCuthillMcKee. Conditional reversals are not only more complex to implement but also slightly more time-consuming, with the only benefit being a marginally smaller matrix profile (a measure of how far, on average, nonzero entries are from the diagonal; see also MatrixBandwidth.profile).

The dense-matrix implementations of both algorithms in this package, however, result in reverse Cuthill–McKee consistently outperforming Gibbs–Poole–Stockmeyer in terms of runtime (although Gibbs–Poole–Stockmeyer still typically produces lower-bandwidth orderings for larger matrices). This further motivates the desire to implement a sparse version of both algorithms in the future.\n\nExamples\n\nIn the following examples, MatrixBandwidth.random_banded_matrix is used to generate random matrices with minimum bandwidth close to k.

Cuthill–McKee considers the graph G(A) whose adjacency matrix is A (ignoring weights and self-loops) and performs a breadth-first search of each connected component of G(A), starting from a low-degree node then visiting its neighbors in order of increasing degree. Particularly effective when A is sparse, this heuristic typically produces an ordering which induces a matrix bandwidth either equal to or very close to the true minimum [CM69, pp. 157–58]. The reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm simply reverses the ordering produced by application of Cuthill–McKee; it was found in [Geo71, pp. 114–15] that although the bandwidth remains the same, this tends to produce a more optimal matrix profile (a measure of how far, on average, nonzero entries are from the diagonal; see also MatrixBandwidth.profile).\n\nAs noted above, the reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm requires structurally symmetric input (that is, Ai j must be nonzero if and only if Aj i is nonzero for 1  i j  n).\n\nPerformance\n\nGiven an nn input matrix A, the reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm runs in O(n²) time.\n\n[CG80] provide a linear-time implementation in the number of nonzero entries of A, which is still quadratic when A is dense but often much faster when dealing with sparse matrices.

However, this version is considerably more complex to implement, and we ran into problems enforcing ILP constraints on node pairs added to opposite ends of the ordering. In any case, computational results demonstrate that neither LAYOUT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT nor LAYOUT_BOTH_WAYS is consistently faster, and the paper states that there is no known heuristic for determining which version will be more performant for a given input [CS05, pp. 368–69].

If this field is not set   (and thus automatically initialized to nothing), a default depth is computed by   dcm_ps_optimal_depth as a function of the input matrix every time the decider   is passed to has_bandwidth_k_ordering as a function of the input matrix.   Otherwise, it must be manually set to a positive integer.\n\nConstructors\n\nDelCorsoManziniWithPS(): constructs a new DelCorsoManziniWithPS instance with the   default perimeter search depth initialized to nothing.\nDelCorsoManziniWithPS(depth::Integer): constructs a new DelCorsoManziniWithPS instance   with the specified perimeter search depth. depth must be a positive integer.\n\nSupertype Hierarchy\n\nDelCorsoManziniWithPS <: AbstractDecider <: AbstractAlgorithm\n\nPerformance\n\nGiven an nn input matrix, perimeter search depth d, and threshold bandwidth k, the Del Corso–Manzini algorithm with perimeter search runs in O(n  max(nᵈ nk)) time:\n\nWe perform a depth-first search of O(n) partial orderings.\nChecking plausibility of each partial ordering takes O(nk) time, and checking   compatibility with all size-d LPOs takes O(nᵈ) time. Thus, the overall time   complexity for each value of k is O(n  (nᵈ + nk)).\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is O(n  max(nᵈ nk)).\n\nOf course, this is but an upper bound on the time complexity of Del Corso–Manzini with perimeter search, achieved only in the most pathological of cases. In practice, efficient pruning techniques and compatibility checks result in approximately exponential growth in time complexity with respect to n.\n\nBased on experimental results, the algorithm is feasible for nn matrices up to n  100 or so.\n\nExamples\n\nHere, Del Corso–Manzini with perimeter search ascertains that A random 3030 matrix has a minimum bandwidth greater than 9. The depth parameter is not explicitly set; instead, some near-optimal value is automatically computed upon the first has_bandwidth_k_ordering function call.\n\nusing Random, SparseArrays\nRandom.seed!(5847);\n(n, p) = (30, 0.05);\nA = sprand(n, n, p);\nA = A + A' # Ensure structural symmetry;\nk = 6;\nhas_bandwidth_k_ordering(A, k, Recognition.DelCorsoManziniWithPS())\n\nNow, Del Corso–Manzini with perimeter search recognizes that a random 3535 matrix has a minimum bandwidth at most 8. In this case, we explicitly set the depth parameter to 4 beforehand instead of relying on Recognition.dcm_ps_optimal_depth.\n\nusing Random, SparseArrays\nRandom.seed!(23552);\n(n, p, depth) = (35, 0.02, 4);\nA = sprand(n, n, p);\nA = A + A' # Ensure structural symmetry;\nk = 8;\nhas_bandwidth_k_ordering(A, k, Recognition.DelCorsoManziniWithPS(depth))\n\nNotes\n\nFor readers of the original paper, what we call the Del Corso–Manzini recognition algorithm with perimeter search here is essentially a wrapper around the underlying AddNode1 and Prune subroutines in what [DM99, p. 193] term the \"MB-PS algorithm\" for bandwidth minimization (not mere recognition). MB-PS (which we also implement in MatrixBandwidth.Minimization.Exact.DelCorsoManziniWithPS) calls this recognition procedure with incrementing values of k until a bandwidth-k ordering is found, with k initialized to some lower bound on the minimum bandwidth of A up to symmetric permutation.\n\n[DM99, p. 191] also describe an \"MB-ID algorithm\" for bandwidth minimization, which we implement in MatrixBandwidth.Minimization.Exact.DelCorsoManzini. Similarly, the underlying recognition subroutine for MB-ID is implemented in DelCorsoManzini.\n\nReferences\n\n[DM99]: G. M. Del Corso and G. Manzini.

The algorithm employs dynamic programming to search over equivalence classes of partial orderings, where two partial orderings of length l are equivalent if they share the same active region. (The active region of a partial ordering is defined as the sequence of the last min(k l) vertices in the ordering taken together with all dangling edges—edges with one endpoint in the ordering and the other endpoint not yet in the ordering.) It extends these partial layouts one vertex at a time in a breadth-first manner, pruning implausible classes that violate bandwidth-k constraints such as degree bounds on active vertices and excessive numbers of dangling edges [GS84].\n\nAs noted above, the Saxe–Gurari–Sudborough algorithm requires structurally symmetric input (that is, Ai j must be nonzero if and only if Aj i is nonzero for 1  i j  n).\n\nSupertype Hierarchy\n\nSaxeGurariSudborough <: AbstractDecider <: AbstractAlgorithm\n\nPerformance\n\nGiven an nn input matrix and threshold bandwidth k, the Saxe–Gurari–Sudborough algorithm runs in O(nᵏ) time [GS84, p. 531]. This is an improvement upon the original O(nᵏ¹) Saxe algorithm [Sax80, p. 363]. (Of course, when k  3, then the initial O(n³) bandwidth lower bound computation performed in all has_bandwidth_k_ordering calls dominates the overall complexity, although the constant scaling factor of that subroutine is generally much smaller than that of the algorithm proper).\n\nWhereas most bandwidth recognition algorithms are technically factorial-time (with respect to n) in the worst case but practically always approximate exponential time complexity in real life (see: DelCorsoManzini), the O(nᵏ) upper bound on Saxe–Gurari–Sudborough is typically a good representation of actual performance in most cases. Indeed, these other types of algorithms tend to outperform Saxe–Gurari–Sudborough for larger k, given that their aggressive pruning strategies keep their effective search space very small in practice.\n\nExamples\n\nusing Random, SparseArrays\nRandom.seed!(274);\n(n, p) = (20, 0.08);\nA = sprand(n, n, p);\nA = A + A' # Ensure structural symmetry;\n(k_false, k_true) = (3, 5);\nhas_bandwidth_k_ordering(A, k_false, Recognition.SaxeGurariSudborough())\nhas_bandwidth_k_ordering(A, k_true, Recognition.SaxeGurariSudborough())\n\nNotes\n\nThis general family of bandwidth recognition algorithms was conceived as a response to a question posed by [GGJK78, p. 494]: is the \"bandwidth ≤ k?\" problem NP-complete for arbitrary k? [Sax80] answered this question in the negative by providing a O(nᵏ¹) algorithm, constructively proving that the problem is class P. Later, [GS84] improved upon this algorithm by reducing time complexity to O(nᵏ). Whereas the original Saxe algorithm considers extensions of partial orderings with any remaining unplaced vertex (of which there are O(n) at any point in the breadth-first search), the Gurari–Sudborough refinement only considers extensions with vertices reachable by paths beginning with a dangling edge that never again traverse a dangling edge [GS84, pp. 535–36].\n\nReferences\n\n[GGJK78]: M.

Effectively, this definition treats diagonal matrices as bandwidth 1, tridiagonal matrices as bandwidth 2, and so on. Our definition, on the other hand, is more common in computer science contexts, treating diagonal matrices as bandwidth 0 and tridiagonal matrices as bandwidth 1.

The bandwidth of an n times n matrix A is the minimum non-negative integer k in 0 1 ldots n - 1 such that A_ij = 0 whenever i - j  k. Reordering the rows and columns of a matrix to reduce its bandwidth has many practical applications in engineering and scientific computing: it can improve performance when solving linear systems, approximating partial differential equations, optimizing circuit layout, and more. There are two variants of this problem: minimization, which involves finding a permutation matrix P such that the bandwidth of PAP^mathsfT is minimized, and recognition, which entails determining whether there exists a permutation matrix P such that the bandwidth of PAP^mathsfT is less than or equal to some fixed non-negative integer (an optimal permutation that fully minimizes the bandwidth of A is not required).\n\nMany matrix bandwidth reduction algorithms exist in the literature, but implementations in the open-source ecosystem are scarce, with those that do exist primarily tackling older, less efficient algorithms. The Boost libraries in C++, the NetworkX library in Python, and the MATLAB standard library all only implement the reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm from 1971. This gap in the ecosystem not only makes it difficult for theoretical researchers to benchmark and compare new proposed algorithms but also precludes the application of the most performant modern algorithms in real-life industry settings. MatrixBandwidth.jl aims to bridge this gap by presenting a unified interface for matrix bandwidth reduction algorithms in Julia, designed with extensibility to further methods in mind.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"The only prerequisite is a working Julia installation (v1.10 or later).
